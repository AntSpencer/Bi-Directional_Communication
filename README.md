This was actually a really fun project to work on. It taught me about:

1.) websockets. This allows me to transfer data between client and server in a bidirectional pattern, allowing for some really cool things to happen. 

2.) Server. This taught me more about Node, and now i feel like its less of a obstacle and more of a challenge to overcome.

3.) Functions. I've only recently grasped the concept of  functions in variables, but this project helped provide some clarity into that.

I started off by followinng a tutorial, but then i realized that it was outdated and needed updated and upgraded, so i looked into Node.Js.
It has the ability to locally host a server and use that for websockets, so i went and found out how to adjust it to run a ws instead of localhost.
Overall, the project went very smootly, and I believe that in the future i will be utilizing aspects of this projects in the future.
